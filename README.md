Back Story

Blue Fever have delivered fantastic training via Youtube, referenced above.  This is NOT a criticism of them:
Online training risks following parrot fashion without fully understanding what you are doing.  When everything works perfectly, this is not a problem.  When things go slightly wrong - which can be as simple as your own typos - you have to go backwards.  I have just hit one of these moments.  I think the underlying problem is:  a timedate stamp is required, but I seem to be trying to get this from an aggregated file.  I also have a detail file, so some re-engineering required.  Watch this space (hopefully only for a short while)
